              Matterhorn in Depth‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäProject Aspects Explained</p>

            <p>Look at this adorable Arctic Fox (Photo by Jonatan Pie on Unsplash)
              Recently, I published an article on my new project, Matterhorn üèî, a Node.js API server boilerplate. It
              provides a
              set of opinionated configuration files and some basic example code. These help developers get up and
              running faster
              with Node.js and TypeScript.</p>

            <p>Matterhorn is inspired by projects like Create React App and Gatsby CLI. The project's goal is to
              eliminate the
              barrier of entry required to use programming tools such as type systems, testing and linting frameworks,
              and even
              basic continuous integration.</p>

            <p>This blog post will review each of the core aspects in Matterhorn. I will discuss details and the
              opinionated
              decision behind the framework of choice.</p>

            <p>Runtime & Type System</p>
            The core of this project is built with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript
            engine. It is
            recommended you use the latest stable version of Node.js to run this project. At the time of writing this
            post, it is
            11.7.0.</p>

            <p>Node.js is driven by a non-blocking event loop which makes it a great choice for building scalable
              network
              applications. For more information on Node.js check out their website.</p>

            <p>Many Node.js projects are written in JavaScript. However, TypeScript, a type system for JavaScript, has
              witnessed a
              spike in attention at the end of 2018. Many developers are interested in learning TypeScript in 2019. Its
              adoption in
              open source JavaScript projects is increasing. The original purpose for Matterhorn was to jump start
              developers
              interested in building backend Node.js applications with TypeScript. As such, Matterhorn itself is
              written in
              TypeScript.</p>

            <p>As a type system, TypeScript is very comprehensive. While it may have a steep learning curve at first,
              the benefits
              from using it are paramount. It helps you, the developer, write cleaner, less buggy code. And once you‚Äôre
              familiar
              with the ecosystem and configuration process, you‚Äôll be writing new features faster than you would with
              native
              JavaScript. Editors such as VSCode have TypeScript enabled by default. It provides an extensive set of
              developer
              tooling to further improve the developer experience.</p>

            <p>API Framework</p>
            <p>While it is possible to write an HTTP API using just Node.js, if a developer wants to achieve ecosystem
              maintainability, security, and scalability, they should use an API framework. When it comes to Node.js
              API
              frameworks, there are many to chose from such as Express, Koa, and Hapi. But there is one framework
              faster and more
              resilient than all the rest: Fastify.</p>


            <p>Fastify logo from https://www.fastify.io</p>
            <p>Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and
              operates on a
              plugin based architecture. It has a very healthy open source community, and over 90 public plugins from
              authentication to database bindings and everything in between. Additionally, Fastify maintains its own
              set of
              TypeScript bindings that are shipped with the module directly from NPM.</p>

            <p>Test Runner and Linter</p>
            <p>Backing up your code with unit tests is a standard in today‚Äôs programming ecosystem. Matterhorn comes
              with Jest, a
              popular JavaScript test runner. It is configured to work with TypeScript and even contains some examples
              for testing
              your Fastify API. Take note of Fastify‚Äôs inject method; it is very useful for testing your routes
              behavior.</p>

            <p>In addition to running tests, Jest is also configured to output code coverage documents. While code
              coverage is not
              the most important metric to consider when writing unit tests, it is valuable and can assist you in
              verifying you‚Äôre
              at least covering as much of your code base as possible.</p>

            <p>In the open source community, code linters are a popular choice for enforcing a certain style of
              programming. They
              negate the need for stylistic code reviews. They can help developers catch errors in their code before
              they run it.</p>

            <p>Matterhorn is equipped with ESLint, a popular choice for JavaScript linting. The project was originally
              shipped with
              TSLint. However, this was swapped out in favor of ESLint because TypeScript officially announced plans to
              directly
              support the ESLint project. The linter is configured to suit the project maintainers opinions. It can
              easily be
              reconfigured for your own stylistic guidelines.</p>

            <p>Continuous Integration</p>
            The final aspect of Matterhorn is the inclusion of a fully configured continuous integration pipeline. For
            many
            developers, especially those learning or just tinkering, this feature may not have much use. However, for
            those
            trying to develop a complete application and want the stability of enterprise development, this CI is for
            them.</p>

            <p>The pipeline is built on Azure DevOps (previously named Visual Studio Team Services). Azure DevOps is
              free for
              public
              repositories, and the pipeline utilities are extensive. It can be configured programmatically
              (Matterhorn) or through
              a visual editor (in a browser). You can check out Matterhorn‚Äôs CI pipeline here. It automatically builds
              for pull
              request updates and any new commits on master.</p>

            <p>Conclusion
              <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about the various aspects of Matterhorn. A lot went into
                consideration when
                picking services and utility modules for this project. The project is open source, and there is plenty
                of room for
                improvement so if you‚Äôd like to contribute check it out below.</p>
